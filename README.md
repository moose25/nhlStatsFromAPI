# nhlStatsFromAPI

Simple python to grab NHL stats for players on selected team

Replace NHL_API_ENDPOINT with the appropriate NHL API endpoint.

Ensure you have the requests library installed. You can install it using pip if you haven't already:
- pip install requests

Run the script, and it will prompt you to enter an NHL team name. Then, it will list the players for that team and allow you to enter the full name of a player to retrieve their detailed statistics.
